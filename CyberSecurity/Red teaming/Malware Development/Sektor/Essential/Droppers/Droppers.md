Droppers are malware designed to deliver and install other forms of malware, called payloads, onto a victim's computer.

Payloads can take various forms: **_shellcode_** (position independent executable code), EXE, DLL, **_reflective DLL_** ("self-loadable" DLL which can load and initialize itself in the process memory without being stored as a file on disk)

This are the sections of PE file used to storage paylaods in a dropper:
- The `.text` (_executable code_) section is typically used to store executable code, such as the instructions that make up the program's actual logic.
- The `.data` (_initialized data_) section is used to store global and static data variables that need to be initialized before the program starts running.
- The `.rsrc` (_resources_) section contains various types of resources used by the application, such as icons, bitmaps, strings, version information, dialog templates, and other non-executable data.
